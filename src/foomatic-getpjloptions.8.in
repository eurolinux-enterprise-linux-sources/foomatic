.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI foomatic-getpjloptions " device"

.BI foomatic-getpjloptions " hostname\ port"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B foomatic-getpjloptions
Sends a set of PJL commands and reads back
the PJL options and status from a printer over a network connection
or device bidirectional interface such as parallel, USB, serial.
printers to standard output. The
output can be piped into foomatic-addpjloptions to add options to the database.


.SS Options
.TP 10
.BI device
The interface to which a local printer is connected, e.g. /dev/lp0, /dev/usb/lp0,
/dev/tty00, etc.
For a parallel port,
you must have bidirectional support enabled at the
BIOS level and the parallel port driver must support the bidirectional mode.
Check your parallel port BIOS settings for  EPP/bi-directional mode.

.TP 10
.BI hostname
Host name or IP address of a network printer (HP JetDirect, DLINK, etc.).

.TP 10
.BI port
Port on which your network printer listens for socket (Appsocket) connections.
Most common ports are 9100 (JetDirect), 10000 (DLINK).  Usually you can configure
the port via a configuration interface.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.B foomatic-getpjloptions

project using output from the associated binary.
Modified by Patrick Powell <papowell at lprng.com> to provide betters
support for network printers, error messages, and remove CR and FF from output.

.SH WARNINGS
Uni-directional protocols as remote LPD are not supported as no status is returned.
Some network print servers which attach to a printer parallel port do not
support bidirectional mode.
