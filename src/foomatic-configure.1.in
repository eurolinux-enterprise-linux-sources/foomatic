.SH DESCRIPTION
.B foomatic-configure 
is a program to set up and configure print queues for every known
spooler (CUPS, LPRng, LPD, GNUlpr, PPR, PDQ. CPS, no spooler) and
every valid printer/driver combo in the Foomatic database or every PPD
file coming with PostScript printers. As RIP filter (Raster Image
Processor, translation from PostScript to the native language of the
printer) always \fBfoomatic-rip(1)\fR will be used, except for PPD
files of PostScript printers under CUPS or PPR, they will be used
without RIP filter.

It also comprises half of a programatic API for user tools: you can
learn and control everything about the static properties of print
queues here. With the sister program \fBfoomatic-printjob(1)\fR, you
can do everything related to the print queue's dynamic state: submit
jobs, and query, cancel, reorder, and redirect them.

.SH BUGS
\fBfoomatic-configure\fR currently cannot handle printcap files in the
\fBlprng\fR style.  As \fBlprng\fR can use BSD style printcaps this is
not much of a problem, as long as the GUI based print manager
\fBlprngtool\fR is not used.
The difference between those formats is, that BSD style requires
continuation lines in printer definitions to be ended with a colon and
the newline character to be escaped with a backslash.  \fBLprng\fR has
no such restriction.

To use a printcap file generated or edited with \fBlprngtool\fR with
\fBfoomatic-configure\fR it is necessary to add \fB:\\\fR to the end
of all but the last line of every printer definition, just as shown
below:
.nf
.sp
.ft CW
#comment
# primary printer name
lp
#alternate names
 |lp2|lp3
 |Example of a printer
 :sd=/usr/spool/LPD/lp
 :rw:lp=/dev/lp:mx#100
 :

.fi
.LP
must be converted to:
